1) facebook and bookface should return the same hashing value, as they have the same letters
2) Stringhash2 is superior because it accounts for letter position and not just the letter being present
3) No because each word is a hashLink, even if it is also a bucket.
4) No, the table load doesn't have anything to do with how the links are distributed in our implementation.
5) Yes, each hash will distribute files differently, so there could be more empty buckets in one hash vs the other.
6) When I ran with 997 on input2.txt i had 483 empty buckets. When I ran with 1000 on input2.txt I had 484 empty buckets (load factor of 10).
   This indicates that the prime size was using the table more efficiently. 
7) Increasing the table size improves the performance of the table, at the cost of additional memory usage.
